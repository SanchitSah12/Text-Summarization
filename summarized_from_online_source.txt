AI is the intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to humans and other animals. Examples of AI tasks include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, and other mappings of inputs. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, generative or creative tools, automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems. AI was founded in 1956 and has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding, followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior.

AI research has been dominated by highly mathematical and statistical machine learning in the first decades of the 21st century. It has been successful in solving many challenging problems throughout industry and academia. AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields. The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it, raising philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence.

Computer scientists and philosophers have suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. AI has also been criticized for overhyping its true technological capabilities.
