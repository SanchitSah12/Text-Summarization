AI will play a vital role in the healthcare sector for diagnosing diseases quickly and more accurately. New drug discovery will be faster and cost-effective with the help of AI. It will also enhance the patient engagement in their care and also make ease appointment scheduling, bill paying, with fewer errors. However, apart from these beneficial uses, one great challenge of AI in healthcare is to ensure its adoption in daily clinical practices. From patient self-service to chat bots, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for diagnosis, and image data analysis to identify candidate molecules in drug discovery, AI is already at work increasing convenience and efficiency, reducing costs and errors, and generally making it easier for more patients to receive the health care they need.While NLP and ML are already being used in health care, they will become increasingly important for their potential to:Improve provider and clinician productivity and quality of care, Enhance patient engagement in their own care and streamline patient access to care , Accelerate the speed and reduce the cost to develop new pharmaceutical treatments  and Personalize medical treatments by leveraging analytics to mine significant, previously untapped stores of non-codified clinical data.
